# Python Indentation:
Indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code line.
Where in other programming languages the indentation in code is for readability only, the indentation in Python is very important.


# Statements:
A computer program is a list of "instructions" to be "executed" by a computer.
In a programming language, these programming instructions are called statements.

# Semicolons (Optional, Rarely Used):
Semicolons are optional in Python. You can write multiple statements on one line by separating them with ; but this is rarely used because it makes it hard to read:

### Ex:
```python
print("Hello"); print("How are you?"); print("Bye bye!")
```
# Double Quotes
Text in Python must be inside quotes. You can use either " double quotes or ' single quotes.

# Print Without a New Line:
By default, the print() function ends with a new line.
If you want to print multiple words on the same line, you can use the end parameter.

# Python Comments:
Ex-1:
```python
#This is a comment
print("Hello, World!")
```
Ex-2:
```python
print("Hello, World!") #This is a comment
```
Ex-3:
```python
"""
This is a comment
written in
more than just one line
"""
print("Hello, World!")
```

# Casting:
If you want to specify the data type of a variable, this can be done with casting.

## Get the Type:
You can get the data type of a variable with the `type()` function.

Ex:
```python
x = 5
y = "John"
print(type(x))
print(type(y))
```
